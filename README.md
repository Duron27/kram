### About kram
kram is a wrapper to several popular encoders.  Most encoders have sources, and have been optimized to use very little memory and generate high quality encodings at all settings.  All kram encoders are currently CPU-based.  Some of these encoders use SSE, and a SSE to Neon layer translates those.  kram was built to be small and used as a library or app.  It's also designed for mobile and desktop use.  The final size with all encoders is under 1MB, and disabling each encoder chops off around 200KB down to a final 200KB app size via dead-code stripping.  The code should compile with C++11 or higher.

kram focuses on sending data efficiently and precisely to the encoders.  kram handles srgb and premul at key points in mip generation.  Source files use mmap to reduce memory, but fallback to file ops if that fails.  Temp files are generated for output, and then renamed in case the app fails or is terminated.  Mips are done in-place, and mip data is written out to a file to reduce memory usage. kram leaves out BC2 and etcrgb8a1 and PVRTC.  Also BC6 still needs an encoder, and ASTC HDR encoding needs a bit more work to pull from half4/float4 source pixels.  

Many of the encoder sources can multithread a single image, but that is unused.  kram is designed to batch process one texture per core/thread via a python script or a C++11 task system inside kram.  This can use more ram depending on the core count.  Texture-per-process and scripted modes currently both take the same amount of CPU time, but scripted mode is best if kram ever adds GPU-accelerated encoding.

Similar to a makefile system, the script sample kramtexture.py uses modstamps to skip textures that have already been processed.  If the source png/ktx is older than the ktx output, then the file is skipped.  Command line options are not yet compared, so if those change then use --force on the python script to rebuild all textures.  Also a crc/hash could be used instead when modstamp isn't sufficient or the same data could come from different folders.

### About kramv
kramv is a viewer for the BC/ASTC/ETC2 and HDR KTX textures generated by kram from LDR PNG and LDR/HDR KTX sources.  kramv decodes ASTC/ETC2 textures on macOS Intel, where the GPU doesn't support them.  macOS with Apple Silicon supports all three formats, and doesn't need to decode.   

This is all in ObjC++ with the intent to port to Windows as time permits.  It's adapted from Apple's Metal sample app.  There's very little GUI and it's all controlled via keyboard to make the code easy to port and change, but the key features are useful for texture triage and analysis.  Drag and drop, and click-launch are supported.  Recently used textures are listed in the menu.  The app is currently single-document only, but I'd like to fix that.  Subsequent opens reuse the same document Window.

Compute shaders are used to display a single pixel sample from the gpu texture.  This simplifies adding more viewable formats in the future, but there is not a cpu fallback.  The preview is rendered to a cube with a single face visible using shaders.  Preview mode provides lighting, sdf cutoff, and mip visuals for a given texture.

In non-preview mode, point sampling in a pixel shader is used to show exact pixel values of a single mip, array, and face.  Debug modes provide pixel analysis.  KramLoader shows synchronous cpu upload to a private Metal texture, but does not yet supply the underlying KTXImage.  Pinch zoom and panning tries to keep the image from onscreen, and zoom is to the cursor so navigating feels intuitive.

```

```

### Limitations

Texture processing is complex and there be dragons.  Just be aware of some of the limitations of kram and encoding.  Lossy compression can only solve so much.  ASTC and BC4-7 are newer formats, but all formats have time and quality tradeoffs.  And encoder quality and issues remain.  WebGL is still often stuck with older formats due to lack of implemented extensions.  And all formats need endpoints/selectors reordering and zstd compression that KTX2 offers.  I added a platform called "any" to with KTX2 holding UASTC+zstd and also ETC2/ASTC/BC+zstd.  The scripts bundle up textures in an archive, but these should go to resource packs and asset catalogs which get signed and can have ODR applied.

```
GPU - none of the encoders use the GPU, so cpu threading and multi-process is used

Rescale Filtering - 1x1 point filter
Mip filtering - 2x2 box filter that's reasonable for pow2, but not ideal for non-pow2 mips, 
  done in linear space using half4 storage, in-place to save mem

1D array - no mip support due to hardware
3D textures - no mip support, uses ASTC 2d slice encode used by Metal/Android, not exotic ASTC 3d format
    
BC/ETC2/ASTC - supposedly WebGL requires pow2, and some implementation need top multiple of 4 for BC/ETC2

BC1 - artifacts from limits of format, artifacts from encoder, use BC7 w/2x memory
BC1 w/alpha - blocked
BC2 - blocked
BC6H - unsupported, no decode either, need to pull BCH encode/decode and pass 8u/16f/32f data

ETC2_RGB8A1 - disabled, broken in ETC2 optimizations

ASTC LDR - rrr1, rrrg/gggr, rgb1, rgba must be followed to avoid endpoint storage, requires swizzles
ASTC HDR - encoder uses 8-bit source image, need 16f/32f passed to encoder, no hw L+A mode

R/RG/RGBA 8/16F/32F - use ktx2ktx2 and ktx2sc KTX2 to supercompress, use as source formats
R8/RG8/R16F - input/output rowBytes not aligned to 4 bytes to match KTX spec, code changes needed

PVRTC - unsupported, no open-source encoders, requires pow2 size

Containers
PVR/DDS/Basis/Crunch - unsupoorted 

KTX - breaks loads of mips with 4 byte length offset at the start of each level of mips, 
  metadata/props aren't standardized and only ascii prop support so easy to dump out

KTX2 - works in kram and viewer, has aligned compressed levels of mips, 
  libkram only supports None/Zstd supercompression, only read no write support, 
  write by converting ktx -> ktx2 with ktx2ktx2 + ktxsc (see kramTexture.py --ktx2 option)

```

### An example pipeline

```
At build:

* Lossless 8u/16F/32F KTX2 sources 2D, 2D, cube, and 2D atlas textures with zstd mips.  Editing these in Photoshop/Gimp is still an issue.
* Need to stop basing pipelines around PNG.  This is a limited source format, but supported by editors.
* Textures should be higher resolution, and checked into source control (git-lfs or p4).  
* Some sort of scripting to supply encoder preset index for textures. 

* Drop mips and encode to KTX using kram using the encoder preset
* Build 2D array or 2D atalas assets and name/uv locations for those assets.
* Convert KTX to KTX2 via ktx2ktx2 + ktx2sc as lossy encoded ETC2/BC/ASTC+zstd or UASTC+rdo+zstd
* Bundle into an Asset Catalog (macOS/iOS), or resource pack (Android) for slicing and on-demand resource loading

At runtime:

* Mmap load all KTX2 textures read-only into memory using KramLoader.  This is the backing-store.
* Decode smaller faces/slices/array and their mips and upload to staging buffer and then gpu transfer/twiddle to private texture. 
* For example, can upload all lower mips in 1/3rd the space and skip all the top mips.  Textures without mips cannot do this.

* Use sparse texturing hardware or readback to indicate what mips are accessed by the hardware.
* Purge top mips of large unused textures, but keep the bottom mips.
* Upload top mips as needed and memory allows.
```

### Building
Kram uses CMake to setup the projects and build.  kramv.app, kram, and libkram are generated, but kramv.app and kram are stand-alone.  The library can be useful in apps that want to include the decoder, or runtime compression of gpu-generated data.

For Mac, the build is out-of-source, and can be built from the command line, or debugged from the xcodeproj that is built.  Ninja and Makefiles can also be generated from cmake, but remember to trash the CMakeCache.txt file.

```
mkdir build
cmake .. -G Xcode

cmake --build . --config Release
or
open kramWorkspace.xcodeproj
or
cmake --install ../bin --config Release
```

For Windows, the steps are similar. I tried to fix CMake to build the library into the app directory so the app is updated.  "Rebuild Solution" if your changes don't take effect, or if breakpoints stop being hit.

```
mkdir build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" 
or
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64

cmake --build . --config Release
or
open kramWorkspace.sln
or
# not sure if install works on Win
cmake --install ../bin --config Release
```

There are various CMake settings that control the various encoders.  Each of these adds around 200KB.  I tested with each of these turned off, so code should be isolated.  The project will still show all sources.

* -DATE=ON
* -DASTCENC=ON
* -DBCENC=ON
* -DSQUISH=ON
* -DETCTOOL=ON

### Commands
* encode - encode/decode block formats, mipmaps, fast sdf, premul, srgb, swizzles, LDR and HDR support, 16f/32f
* decode - can convert any of the encode formats to s/rgba8 ktx files for display 
* info   - dump dimensions and formats and metadata/props from png and ktx files
* script - send a series of kram commands that are processed in a task system.  Ammenable to gpu acceleration.

### Sample Scripts
* kramTextures.py  - python3 example that recursively walks directories and calls kram, or accumulates command and runs as a script
* formatSources.sh - zsh script to run clang_format on the kram source directory (excludes open source)
* fixfinder.sh - after updating /Applications, this flushes any cached copy of kram.app from LaunchServices

To demonstrate how kram works, scripts/kramtextures.py applies platform-specific presets based on source filenames endings.  The first form executes multiple kram processes with each file using a Python ThreadPoolExecutor.  The second generates a script file, and then runs that in a C++ task system inside kram.  The scripting system would allow gpu compute of commands, and more balanced memory and thread usage.


```
cd build

# this will install "click" and other python package dependencies
macOS
pip3 install -r ../scripts/requirements.txt

Win
python3.exe -m pip install -U pip
python3.exe -m pip install -r ../scripts/requirements.txt

# this uses 8 processes, and bundles the results to a zip file
../scripts/kramTextures.py --jobs 8 -p android --bundle

# this writes out a script of all commands and runs on threads in a single process
../scripts/kramTextures.py --jobs 8 -p ios --script
../scripts/kramTextures.py --jobs 8 -p mac --script --force 
../scripts/kramTextures.py --jobs 8 -p win --script --force 

# To move towards supercompressed ktx2 files, the following flags convert ktx output to ktx2

# if ktxsc and ktx2ktx2 are present in the path, then these scripts generate ktx2 output, and then bundle them into a zip
../scripts/kramTextures.py -p any --ktx2 --bundle
../scripts/kramTextures.py -p android --ktx2 --bundle --check

# if ktxsc and ktx2ktx2 are present in the path, this runs kramTextures across all platforms, requires ktx2ktx2
../scripts/kramTests.sh 

```

### Sample Commands
To test individual encoders, there are tests cases embedded into kram.  Also individual textures can be processed, or the script records these commands and executes the encodes on multiple cores.

```
cd build
./Release/kram -testall
./Release/kram -test 1002

./Release/kram encode -f astc4x4 -srgb -premul -quality 49 -mipmax 1024 -type 2d -i ../tests/src/ColorMap-a.png -o ../tests/out/ios/ColorMap-a.ktx
./Release/kram encode -f etc2rg -signed -normal -quality 49 -mipmax 1024 -type 2d -i ../tests/src/collectorbarrel-n.png -o ../tests/out/ios/collectorbarrel-n.ktx
./Release/kram encode -f etc2r -signed -sdf -quality 49 -mipmax 1024 -type 2d -i ../kram/tests/src/flipper-sdf.png -o ../tests/out/ios/flipper-sdf.ktx

```

### Open Source Encoder Usage
This app would not be possible without the open-source contributions from the following people and organizations.  These people also inspired me to make this app open-source, and maybe this will encourage more great tools or game tech.

Kram includes the following encoders/decoders:

Avoid reading off end of arrays with padding.
Support 2d array of src pixels instead of 3d.
Force AVX and SSE path, and implement using sse2neon emlation on Neon.

Etc2comp 
Simplified to single folder.
Keep r11 and rg11 in integer space. 6x faster.
Memory reduced signficantly.  One block allocated.
Single pass encoder works on one block at a time, and does not skip blocks.

* Toof-a is my own artwork drawn in Figma

### Timings for test suite

These are basic timings running kram encoding for all the specific platform test cases using kramTexture.py 
Impressive that M1 wins on the Android test case by over 2x, and is close in the others.

* Date: 1/16/21
* 2020 M1 13" Macbook Air, 3.4Ghz, 4+4 core M1, 8GB
* 2019 16" Macbook Pro, 2.3Ghz, 8/16 core i9, 16GB

Timings
* Any - Basis supercompress via ktxsc is long with UASTC + RDO

| Sys  | macOS  | iOS    | Android | Any    |
|------|--------|--------|---------|--------|

### On Encoding Formats
```
*ASTC* 
Android and iOS, Apple M1
Requires swizzles to reduce endpoint storage (rrr1, rrrg, rgb1)
Full 8-bit channel endpoints
No HDR L+A dualplane, only RGB1
No signed format
ASTC4x4 is same size as R8Unorm explicit format.
Can change block size across all mips 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 8x8...
Hard to store/fit endpoints to larger point clouds
Square format pixel counts ramp up quickly. 16, 25, 36, 64.
Adapts per block to L, LA, RGB, RGBA.
High encoder complexity, but getting faster
No GPU encode/decode.
Fast ISPC encoder but that doesn't pick best block types
Fixed 16 byte block size (even for HDR).  
Optimal storage depends on how much wasted on endpoints
Can fit more than 2 colors to a 4x4 block

rrr1  - 2 1-byte endpoints
rrrg  - 2 2-byte endpoints, dual plane possible in LDR
rg01  - 2 3-byte endpoints, dual plane possible, only 2 channel format in HDR
rgba1 - 2 3-byte endpoints

*ETC2*
Android and iOS, Apple M1
No GPU encode/decode
Etcpak and ETC2Comp are two encoders.   Etcpak is fast with AVX2, less for ARM.
ETC2Comp encoder slow on rgb/a due to large iteration space of each block.  
ETC2Comp multipass skips encoding blocks by treating quality as percentage which is dubious, fixed in Kram.
Kram breaks out quality from block percentage for multipass.

r - 4bpp, 2 11-bit endpoints, unpacks to r16f in texture cache, signed/unsigned
rg - 8bpp, 2 22-bit endpoints, unpacks to rg16f in texture cache, signed/unsigned
rgb - 4bpp, similar to ETC1, several permuations that slow encode times
rgba - 8bpp, has several permuations that slow encode times

*BC*
Desktop and consoles, Apple M1
GPU accelerated encoders
Several encoders to choose from
Can fit more than 2 unique colors to a 4x4 block with BC7, but no BC1/3
GPU accelerators 100 to 1000x faster.

BC1 - 4bpp, 565, 2-bit selector, kram doesn't support 1-bit alpha form
BC2 - not exposed

### On mip calculations and non-power-of-two textures

With the exception of PVRTC, the block encoded formats support non-power-of-two mipmaps.  But very little literature talks about how mips are calculated.  D3D first used round-down mips, GL followed suit, and Metal/Vulkan followed suit.  Round down cuts out a mip level, and does a floor of the mip levels.   Round-up mips generally have a better mapping to the upper with a simple box filter.  Kram hasn't adjusted it's box filter to adjust for this yet, but there are links into the code to articles about how to better weight pixels.  The kram box filter is correct for power-of-two mipgen, but should be improved for these cases.

```
Round Down
3px  a      b      c
1px       a+b+c

Round Up
3px  a      b      c
2px    a+b     b+c 
1px      a+b+c
```

### On memory handling in Kram:

Batch processing on multiple threads can use a lot of memory.  Paging can reduce performance.  Kram memory maps the source png/ktx, decodes the png into memory or reads ktx pixels from the mmap, pulls chunks for the slice/cube/texture, then generates mips in place, and uses a half4 type for srgb/premul to maintain higher precision, and finally writes the mip to disk.  Then kram process another mip.

The rgba8u image and half4 image are stored for mips.  1gb can be used to process separate textures on 16 cores.  This may be an argument for multiple cores processing a single image.  Running fewer threads can reduce peak memory use.  Also hyperthreaded cores share SIMD units, so using physical processor counts may be similar performance to HT counts.  Alignment is maintained and memory is reduced with in-place mips, but that also means mipgen in kram is intermingled with encoding.

| Dims   | MPix | 8u MB | 16f MB | 32f MB |
|--------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1024^2 |  1   |  4    |  8     |  16    |
| 2048^2 |  4   |  16   |  32    |  64    |
| 4096^2 | 16   |  64   |  128   |  256   |
| 8192^2 | 64   |  256  |  512   |  1024  |

### On lossless PNG, KTX, KTX2 output formats:

PNG is limited to srgb8u/8u/16u data.  Most editors can work with this format.  Gimp and Photoshop can maintain 16u data.  There's no provision for mips, or cube, 3d, hdr, or premultiplied alpha.  And most tools always set png as sRGB data.  Content tools, image editors, browsers really need to replace PNG and DDS with compressed KTX2 for source and output content. 

kram encourages the use of lossless and hdr source data.  There are not many choices for lossless data - PNG, EXR, and Tiff to name a few.  Instead, kram can input PNG files with 8u pixels, and KTX/2 files for 8u/16f/32f pixels.  Let kram convert source pixels to premultiplied alpha and from srgb to linear, since ordering matters here and kram does this using half4/float4.  LDR and HDR data can come in as horizontal or vertical strips, and these strips can then have mips generated for them.  So cube maps, cube map arrays, 2D arrays, and 1d arrays are all handled the same.

KTX is a well-designed format, and KTX2 continues that tradition.  It was also faily easy to convert between these formats.  Once mips are decoded, KTX2 looks very much like KTX.

Visually validating and previewing the results is complicated.  KTX/2 have few viewers, hence the need for kramv.  Apple's Preview can open BC and ASTC files on macOS, but not ETC/PVRTC.  And then you can't look at channels or mips, or turn on/off premultiplied alpha, or view signed/unsigned data.  Preview premultiplies PNG images, but KTX files aren't.  Apple's thumbnails don't work for ETC2 or PVRTC data in KTX files.  Windows thumbnails don't work for KTX at all.  PVRTexToolGUI 2020R2 applies sRGB incorrectly to images, and can't open BC4/5/7 files on Mac.  

Kram adds props to KTX/2 file to store data.  Currently props store Metal and Vulkan formats.  This is important since GL's ASTC LDR and HDR formats are the same constant.  Also props are saved for channel content and post-swizzle.  Loaders, viewers, and shaders can utilize this metadata.

KTX can be converted to KTX2 and each mip supercompressed via ktx2ktx2 and ktxsc.  KTX2 reverses mip ordering smallest to largest, so that streamed textures can display smaller mips before they finish fully streaming.  KTX2 can also supercompress each mip with zstd and Basis for transcode.  I suppose this could then be unpacked to tiles for sparse texturing.  KTX2 does not store a length field inside the mip data which keeps consistent alignment. 

Metal cannot load mmap mip data that isn't aligned to a multiple of the block size (8 or 16 bytes for BC/ASTC/ETC).  KTX adds a 4 byte length into the mip data that breaks alignment, but KTX2 fortunately skips that.  But KTX2 typically compresses the levels and needs decode/transcode to send to the GPU.

Note that textures and render textures don't necessarily use pixels or encoded blocks in the order that you specify in the KTX file.  Twiddling creates serpentine patterns of pixels/blocks that are platform and hardware dependent.  Hardware often writes to linear for the display system, and reads/writes twiddled layouts.  It's hard for a generic tool like kram to address this.  I recommend that the texture loader always upload ktx blocks to private texture surfaces, and let the API twiddle the data during the copy.  This can sometimes be a source of upload timing differences.

* KTX mmap -> Copy Level to Shared Buffer -> Blit Level to Private Tex
* KTX2 mmap -> Decompress Level to Shared Buffer -> Blit Level To Private Tex

With sparse texture, the above becomes more involved since only parts of the decompressed level are uploaded.  KTX2 is still the ideal choice, since textures are considerably smaller 2-10x and can be mmap-ed directly from the bundle.

### Encoding and hardware lookup of srgb and premultiplied data.

```
Texture units convert srgb to linear data on the way to the texture cache.  
The texture cache typically stores 4x4 block to match encoded formats.  
Sampling is then done from that block of linear data with higher precision.

Texturing hardware does not yet support premultiplied alpha.  
Kram does premul prior to mip generation.
Srgb is then re-applied to linear premul data before encoding.

Kram uses half4/float4 to preserve precision when srgb or premul are specified.  
The encoders all have to encode non-linear srgb point clouds, which isn't correct.

```
